# Maze-generator-and-solver
This project is an interactive Maze Generator and Solver built using Python and Pygame. It visualizes how different maze generation and pathfinding algorithms work in real time. Users can generate a random maze using Recursive Backtracking or Prim’s Algorithm, and then solve it using DFS, BFS, or the A* algorithm.
